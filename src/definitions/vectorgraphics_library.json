The arc's radii have to be passed in `ra` and `rb`, and the start and end angles have to be specified in the `start` and `end` arguments respectively. All angles must be specified in degrees. If you want to have a closed ellipse, the start argument needs to be 0 and the end argument needs to be 360. Using the [AddEllipseToPath()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/AddEllipseToPath_.html) command is of course easier in this case. The optional argument `clockwise` can be used to specify whether or not the elliptical arc shall be drawn in clockwise direction. This tag defaults to `True` which means clockwise drawing. If you set it to `False`, `AddArcToPath()` will connect the angles in anti- clockwise direction.\n\nNote that `AddArcToPath()` doesn't add a center point vertex. If you want the start and end angles of the arc to be connected with the center point, you need to do this manually by calling [MoveTo()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/MoveTo_.html) before `AddArcToPath()` and [LineTo()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/LineTo_.html) afterwards.\n\nAlso note that `AddArcToPath()` only starts a new subpath in case there is no active subpath.

Because of that, this command will only work when a vector font (e.g. a TrueType font) is currently active. It will not work with bitmap fonts. `AddTextToPath()` will use the active font that was set by the last call to [SetFont()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetFont_.html) or [UseFont()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/UseFont_.html).\n\nPlease note that `AddTextToPath()` will add the text above the current y-point. Thus, if the path's current y-point is 240 and you add text to it that is 36 pixels high, the text will be placed at an y-position of 204 (240-36=204) instead of 240 as the current y-point might suggest.\n\nPlease note that there are currently some restrictions:\n\n- The font to be used with `AddTextToPath()` must have been opened using `#FONTENGINE_INBUILT`. Fonts that have been opened using `#FONTENGINE_NATIVE` will currently not work. The default inbuilt fonts `#SANS`, `#SERIF`, and `#MONOSPACE` will work just fine with `AddTextToPath()`.\n\n- Any styles set by [SetFontStyle()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetFontStyle_.html) will be ignored by `AddTextToPath()`. If you want italic or bold text, you need to open a separate font that has the bold and/or italicized vector graphics already in its face data. Simply calling [SetFontStyle()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetFontStyle_.html) does not work with vector text.\n\n- Similarly, all formatting tags that are recognized by [Print()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/Print_.html), [TextOut()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/TextOut_.html), and [CreateTextObject()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/CreateTextObject_.html) are ignored by `AddTextToPath()`.

    "functionDocs": "This command can be used to redirect all drawing commands of Hollywood's standard graphics primitives library to the new vector-path based draw library. This is especially useful for round shapes like circles, arcs, and ellipses, because the standard drawing library is line-based, which means that round shapes will never look perfectly round because their round shape must be approximated through lines. The vector-path based drawing library on the other hand can draw perfectly round shapes which will look better than the line-based approach of the standard drawing library.\n\nTo enable the path-based drawing for the standard functions, pass `True` to `ForcePathUse()`. Then, the following standard functions will be patched to make use of the new vector-path based drawing: [Arc()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/Arc_.html), [Box()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/Box_.html), [Circle()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/Circle_.html), [Ellipse()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/Ellipse_.html), and [Polygon()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/Polygon_.html).\n\nKeep in mind, though, that if you enable path-based drawing for the standard library, you will always get layers of type `#VECTORPATH` if layers are enabled. The standard draw library on the other hand would add layers of type `#ARC`, `#BOX`, `#CIRCLE`, `#ELLIPSE`, and `#POLYGON` respectively. Normally, this does not make much of a difference, but it can be an issue if you try to change the attributes of a layer using [SetLayerStyle()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetLayerStyle_.html), because layers of type `#VECTORPATH` do not have the same functionality than the other layer types. See [SetLayerStyle](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetLayerStyle_.html).\n\nPlease also note that in Hollywood versions earlier than 6.0 your script will require a vectorgraphics plugin if you pass `True` here. Starting with Hollywood 6.0 there is an inbuilt vectorgraphics engine as well.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that vector-path based drawing is of course slower than the polygon based drawing of the standard drawing library.

    "functionDocs": "This function can be used together with the generic [For](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/PrgFor_.html) statement to traverse all items in a path. It returns an iterator function which will return a table that contains information about the next item in the path. Once all path items have been returned, the iterator function will return [Nil](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/PrgTypeNil_.html) to break the generic [For](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/PrgFor_.html) statement.\n\nSee [Generic For statement](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/PrgFor_.html).\n\nThe table returned by `PathItems()` will contain a `Type` field which contains a string that describes the item type. All further table fields depend on the item type as returned in `Type`. The following types are currently supported:\n\n- `NewSubPath`: This item starts a new sub-path. The current point will be undefined at this time. There are no additional arguments.\n\n- `ClosePath`: Closes the current path by drawing a line from the current point to the first point in the sub-path. There are no additional arguments.\n\n- `MoveTo`: This command begins a new sub-path. The sub-path's current point will be set to the specified position. The `MoveTo` table contains the following three additional arguments:\n\n  - `Rel`: This is a boolean value that indicates whether the coordinates are relative or absolute values. If this is `True`, the coordinates have to be interpreted as relative to the current point.\n\n  - `X`: The x coordinate of the new position.\n\n  - `Y`: The y coordinate of the new position.\n\n- `LineTo`: This draws a line from the current point to the specified position. Additionally, it will change the current point to the line's end point when it is done. The `LineTo` table contains the following three additional arguments:\n\n  - `Rel`: This is a boolean value that indicates whether the coordinates are relative or absolute values. If this is `True`, the coordinates have to be interpreted as relative to the current point.\n\n  - `X`: The x coordinate of the new position.\n\n  - `Y`: The y coordinate of the new position.\n\n  If there is no current point, `LineTo` will behave as if it was `MoveTo`, i.e. it will simply set the current point to the specified vertex.\n\n- `CurveTo`: This command draws a Bézier curve that runs from the current point to the position passed in the final two coordinates. The other four coordinates are the control points for the curve. Additionally, it will change the current point to the curve's end point when it is done. The `CurveTo` table contains the following seven additional arguments:\n\n  - `Rel`: This is a boolean value that indicates whether the coordinates are relative or absolute values. If this is `True`, the coordinates have to be interpreted as relative to the current point.\n\n  - `X1`: The x coordinate of the first control point.\n\n  - `Y1`: The y coordinate of the first control point.\n\n  - `X2`: The x coordinate of the second control point.\n\n  - `Y2`: The y coordinate of the second control point.\n\n  - `X3`: The x coordinate of the end point.\n\n  - `Y3`: The y coordinate of the end point.\n\n  If there is no current point, `CurveTo` will use the point passed in (x1,y1) as the current point.\n\n- `Arc`: This command will draw an elliptical arc. `Arc` will open a new subpath for the new arc only in case there is no currently active subpath. If there is already a subpath, `Arc` will connect its starting vertex with the current vertex of the subpath. `Arc` will not close the subpath when it has finished adding its vertices. `Arc` will not connect the start and end angles of the arc with its center point automatically. This has to be requested explicitly by issuing separate `MoveTo` and `LineTo` commands before and after `Arc`. The `Arc` table contains the following additional arguments:\n\n  - `XC`: The x center point of the arc.\n  - `YC`: The y center point of the arc.\n  - `RA`: Arc's radius on the x axis.\n  - `RB`: Arc's radius on the y axis.\n  - `Start`: Start angle in degrees.\n  - `End`: End angle in degrees.\n  - `Clockwise`: Whether or not the angles should be connected in clockwise direction.\n\n  When `Arc` is done, it will set the current point to the position of the end angle.\n\n- `Box`: This command will draw a rectangle. `Box` will first open a new subpath, then add the rectangle's vertices to it and close the subpath when it is finished. Optionally, the rectangle can have rounded corners. The `Box` table contains the following additional arguments:\n\n  - `X`: X position of the rectangle.\n  - `Y`: Y position of the rectangle.\n  - `Width`: Rectangle width.\n  - `Height`: Rectangle height.\n  - `Round`: This is a table which contains four integer values in the range from 0 to 100 specifying the degree of rounding for the four corners of the rectangle. A value of 0 means no rounding, 100 means full rounding.\n\n- `Text`: This command will draw vector text relative to the current point. The individual characters are added as closed subpaths. The `Text` table contains the following additional arguments:\n\n  - `Size`: Desired font size.\n\n  - `Text`: The string to draw.\n\n  When `Text` is done, it will set the current point to where the next character would be displayed.",

Furthermore, the paths combined inside the vector brush can also use different drawing styles.\n\nYou have to pass a table in the `table` argument that contains a number of subtables specifying information about the individual paths to be embedded inside the vector brush. The paths are drawn into the vector brush in exactly the same order as they appear in that table.\n\nNote that each path to be embedded inside the vector brush will be normalized first. Thus, by default all paths will be drawn in the top-left corner of the vector brush. You can change this behaviour by specifying the `X` and `Y` arguments in the individual subtables for each path to be added to the vector brush (see below).\n\nThe following subtable fields can be specified:\n\n- `ID`: This must be set to the identifier of the path object to be embedded inside the vector brush that shall be created. This must always be provided. Note that `PathToBrush()` will make a copy of this path so subsequent modifications of the path won't affect the new vector brush in any way. You may also free this path after adding it to the vector brush.\n\n- `X`: The x position where this path should be drawn inside the vector brush. This position must be relative to the left corner of the vector brush. Note that `PathToBrush()` will internally normalize the path before adding it to the vector brush so you will usually have to use this field to position the path correctly inside the vector brush. Defaults to 0.\n\n- `Y`: The y position where this path should be drawn inside the vector brush. This position must be relative to the top corner of the vector brush. Note that `PathToBrush()` will internally normalize the path before adding it to the vector brush so you will usually have to use this field to position the path correctly inside the vector brush. Defaults to 0.\n\n- `Color`: The path will be drawn in this [ARGB color](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/ARGBInfo_.html). This color can also contain a transparency setting. Defaults to `#BLACK`.\n\nNote that the form and fill styles to be used by the individual paths are the ones that were active at the time the path was created using [StartPath()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/StartPath_.html).

The new sub-path will not get a current point so that most of the time you should better call [MoveTo()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/MoveTo_.html) to start a new sub-path. `StartSubPath()` is only preferable for rare cases in which a current point is not desired; for example, when adding a circle/ellipse/arc to a path a current point can be annoying because it would be connected to the circle/ellipse/arc then. For most cases, however, you should use [MoveTo()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/MoveTo_.html) instead of `StartSubPath()`.",
