By adding `@APPENTRY` to your helper scripts you can tell Hollywood the name of the main script. Whenever you run one of the helper scripts and Hollywood encounters the `@APPENTRY` definition, it will run the main script instead of the helper script.\n\nFor example, let's suppose your project consists of the following three scripts:\n\n```\nmain.hws\nengine.hws\nutils.hws\n```\n\nYou could then place the following line at the top of the helper scripts, i.e. at the top of `engine.hws` and `utils.hws`:\n\n```\n@APPENTRY \"main.hws\"\n```\n\nWith that definition Hollywood will run `main.hws` whenever you start `engine.hws` or `utils.hws` because `main.hws` has been set as the entry script. This can be very convenient, e.g. when editing helper scripts in the Hollywood IDE. If you use `@APPENTRY` you can just click on \"Run\" and the IDE will run the main script instead.",

    "synopsis": "@APPICON table  \n@APPICON f$     (V8.0)",
    "functionDocs": "This preprocessor command can be used to specify an icon for your application. On Windows, macOS, and Linux this icon will appear in the window's border and in several elements of the window manager like the task bar. On AmigaOS 4, the icon will appear in AmiDock if your script runs as a registered AmigaOS 4 application. The icon you specify here will also be linked into the applets and executables you compile with Hollywood. By default, executables compiled by Hollywood will always use the standard Hollywood icon (the clapperboard). If you prefer to use your own icon instead, use this preprocessor command.\n\nStarting with Hollywood 8.0 there are two different ways of using this preprocessor command: You can either specify individual images for the different icon sizes in a table (see below) or you can simply pass a Hollywood icon that has been created using the [SaveIcon()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SaveIcon_.html) function to this preprocessor command. In that case, the icon has to be passed in the `f$` parameter. Specifying a single icon instead of a whole table results in code that is more readable but of course it requires you to generate the icon using Hollywood's [SaveIcon()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SaveIcon_.html) command first.\n\nIf you want to pass individual images for the different icon sizes, you have to pass a table in the `table` argument to this preprocessor command. The table can contain one or more of the following tags:\n\n- `Ic16x16`: Custom icon in the resolution of 16x16 pixels.\n\n- `Ic16x16s`: Selected state icon for size 16x16. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic24x24`: Custom icon in the resolution of 24x24 pixels.\n\n- `Ic24x24s`: Selected state icon for size 24x24. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic32x32`: Custom icon in the resolution of 32x32 pixels.\n\n- `Ic32x32s`: Selected state icon for size 32x32. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic48x48`: Custom icon in the resolution of 48x48 pixels.\n\n- `Ic48x48s`: Selected state icon for size 48x48. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic64x64`: Custom icon in the resolution of 64x64 pixels.\n\n- `Ic64x64s`: Selected state icon for size 64x64. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic96x96`: Custom icon in the resolution of 96x96 pixels.\n\n- `Ic96x96s`: Selected state icon for size 96x96. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic128x128`: Custom icon in the resolution of 128x128 pixels.\n\n- `Ic128x128s`: Selected state icon for size 128x128. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic256x256`: Custom icon in the resolution of 256x256 pixels.\n\n- `Ic256x256s`: Selected state icon for size 256x256. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic512x512`: Custom icon in the resolution of 512x512 pixels.\n\n- `Ic512x512s`: Selected state icon for size 512x512. (V6.0)\n\n- `Ic1024x1024`: Custom icon in the resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. (V7.0)\n\n- `Ic1024x1024s`: Selected state icon for size 1024x1024. (V7.0)\n\n- `DefaultIcon`: This tag lets you specify which icon should be the default icon. You need to pass a string here that describes an icon size from the sizes listed above, e.g. \"64x64\" designates the icon specified in the `Ic64x64` tag as the default icon. The default icon is the icon that Hollywood will show in AmiDock on AmigaOS4 if the `RegisterApplication` tag in [@OPTIONS](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atOPTIONS_.html) has been set to `True`. Thus, currently, the `DefaultIcon` tag only has an effect on AmigaOS 4. (V6.0)\n\nThe reason why this preprocessor command does not simply accept just a single 512x512 icon and then scales it down to all other resolutions is that very small icons like 16x16 or 24x24 do not really look very good when scaled down from a larger icon. They look much better when they are handcrafted for each size. That is why this preprocessor command accepts so many different tags.\n\nPlease note that not all sizes are currently supported on all platforms but you should make sure to provide icons for all these sizes. If you leave a size out, Hollywood might fall back to its default icon (clapperboard) for the size. So if you intend to use your own icons, make sure that you always provide it in all sizes listed above.\n\nThe image file that is required as a parameter by the tags listed above should be a PNG image with alpha channel. Images without alpha channel are supported as well, but this is not recommended because it doesn't look too good.\n\nPlease note that it is mandatory to use the `DefaultIcon` tag on AmigaOS 4 to indicate which icon size should be shown in AmiDock. If you do not pass the `DefaultIcon` tag, Hollywood will display its default icon in AmiDock (the clapperboard). If you want to show an icon in AmiDock that uses a custom size not listed above, you can use the `DockyBrush` tag that is supported by the [@OPTIONS](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atOPTIONS_.html) preprocessor command. See [OPTIONS](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atOPTIONS_.html). Please note that Hollywood supports two different docky types on AmigaOS 4: Standard dockies and app dockies. See [AmiDock information](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/AmiDockInfo_.html).\n\nStarting with Hollywood 6.0 you can specify two images for every icon size because on AmigaOS and compatibles icons usually contain two different states whereas on all other platforms icons are just single static images. If you only target non-Amiga systems, you do not have to provide icons for the selected state because they won't be used anyway.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use one of the [-iconXXX](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/ManualUsage_.html) console arguments instead of `@APPICON`.\n\nNote that this preprocessor command currently does not have any effect on Amiga systems. If you would like to change the icon that Hollywood displays when it is minimized on Workbench, use the [SetWBIcon()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetWBIcon_.html) command.",

    "functionDocs": "This function saves the table `prefs`, containing user preferences for your application, to an external file. You can then load these preferences back into your program the next time your program is started by using the [LoadPrefs()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/LoadPrefs_.html) function. The actual location where the preferences file will be stored is platform-dependent.\n\nNote that this function will only work if you have specified a unique identifier for your application by using the [@APPIDENTIFIER](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atAPPIDENTIFIER_.html) preprocessor command. See [APPIDENTIFIER](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atAPPIDENTIFIER_.html).\n\nStarting with Hollywood 9.0, this function accepts a new optional table argument that can be used to specify further options.\n\nThe following tags are currently recognized in the optional table argument:\n\n- `Adapter`: This table tag can be used to specify the serializer that should be used to export the preferences. This can be the name of an external serializer plugin (e.g. `xml`) or it can be one of the following inbuilt serializers:\n\n  - `Default`: Use Hollywood's default serializer. This will serialize the preferences to the JSON format.\n\n  - `Inbuilt`: Use Hollywood's legacy serializer. This will serialize the table into a custom, proprietary format.\n\n  If the `Adapter` tag isn't specified, it will default to the default set using [SetDefaultAdapter()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetDefaultAdapter_.html).\n\n- `UserTags`: This tag can be used to specify additional data that should be passed to serializer plugins. If you use this tag, you must set it to a table of key-value pairs that contain the additional data that should be passed to plugins. See [User tags](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/UserTagsInfo_.html). (V10.0)",

At the next program start you can load the preferences by using the [LoadPrefs()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/LoadPrefs_.html) function.
