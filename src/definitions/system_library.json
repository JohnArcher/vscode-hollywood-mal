All Hollywood functions that support loaders of the specified type will then default to the loader set using this function.\n\nThe following loader types are currently supported by Hollywood and can be passed in `type`:\n\n- `#LOADER_IMAGE`: Image loaders, used for example by functions like [LoadBrush()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/LoadBrush_.html).\n\n- `#LOADER_ANIM`: Animation loaders, used for example by functions like [OpenAnim()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/OpenAnim_.html).\n\n- `#LOADER_SOUND`: Sound loaders, used for example by functions like [OpenMusic()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/OpenMusic_.html).\n\n- `#LOADER_VIDEO`: Video loaders, used for example by functions like [OpenVideo()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/OpenVideo_.html).\n\n- `#LOADER_ICON`: Icon loaders, used for example by functions like [LoadIcon()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/LoadIcon_.html).\n\n- `#LOADER_FONT`: Font loaders, used for example by functions like [OpenFont()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/OpenFont_.html).\n\nThe default loader for all the loader types listed above is `default` which means that Hollywood will first ask plugin loaders, then inbuilt loaders, then native loaders to open a file. An exception is `#LOADER_FONT` where, due to compatibility reasons, only native loaders will be asked to open the font.\n\nThe string you pass in `loader$` can contain one or more loaders. If several loaders are specified, they must be separated by `|` characters. See [Loaders and adapters](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/LoaderAdapterInfo_.html).",

    "shortDescription": "show system notification",
    "version": "8.0",
    "synopsis": "ShowNotification(title$, msg$[, table])",
    "functionDocs": "This function can be used to pop up a system notification box that shows the message passed in `msg$` to the user. The notification box will use the title specified in `title$`. If you pass an empty string (\"\") in the `title$` parameter, the notification will use the title specified in the [@APPTITLE](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atAPPTITLE_.html) preprocessor command.\n\nThe optional table argument can be used to configure further parameters for the system notification. The following tags are currently recognized by the `table` argument:\n\n- `Icon`: This tag can be used to set the icon that should be shown inside the notification box if the host system supports it. The following icon types can currently be specified here:\n\n  - `#REQICON_NONE`: No icon\n  - `#REQICON_INFORMATION`: An information sign\n  - `#REQICON_ERROR`: An error sign\n  - `#REQICON_WARNING`: A warning sign\n  - `#REQICON_QUESTION`: A question mark\n\n  Note that not all platforms support this tag.\n\n- `Timeout`: This tag can be used to specify a timeout in milliseconds for the notification. If this tag is set, the notification will disappear after the specified time (in milliseconds) has elapsed. Otherwise the notification will use the host system's default timeout value for notifications. You can also pass one of the following special constants here:\n\n  - `#DURATION_SHORT`: Use this for a short notification.\n\n  - `#DURATION_LONG`: Use this for a long notification.\n\n  Note that on Android, you must pass one of the special constants listed above. Passing a millisecond value directly isn't supported on Android. Also note that not all platforms support the `Timeout` tag.\n\n- `X`: Desired horizontal position for the notification. This can also be one of Hollywood's special coordinate constants like `#CENTER`. This tag is only supported on Android and iOS.\n\n- `Y`: Desired vertical position for the notification. This can also be one of Hollywood's special coordinate constants like `#CENTER`. This tag is only supported on Android and iOS.\n\n- `NoSound`: Set this tag to `True` if you don't want any sound to accompany the notification. This tag is currently only supported on macOS.\n\nNote that on Windows notifications can only be shown if your application has a tray icon. Thus, `ShowNotification()` will automatically add a tray icon for your application if there is none yet. If you would like to manually install a tray icon for your application on Windows, call [SetTrayIcon()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetTrayIcon_.html) before calling `ShowNotification()`. See [SetTrayIcon](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/SetTrayIcon_.html).\n\nAlso note that on AmigaOS 4 `ShowNotification()` is implemented through application.library's Ringhio system and thus can only be used if your script has registered itself as an AmigaOS 4 application using the `RegisterApplication` tag in [@OPTIONS](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atOPTIONS_.html). If you need fine-tuned control over Ringhio messages and you don't need to be portable, you can also use the [ShowRinghioMessage()](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/ShowRinghioMessage_.html) function on AmigaOS 4 instead because this offers even more configuration options. See [ShowRinghioMessage](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/ShowRinghioMessage_.html).\n\nOn MorphOS `ShowNotification()` uses MagicBeacon's notification system. On AmigaOS 3 Ranchero is used for showing notifications. Note that since apps need to register before they can show notifications with Ranchero it's recommended that if you intend to use `ShowNotification()` on AmigaOS 3 with Ranchero you should also use [@APPIDENTIFIER](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/docs/html/hollywood/atAPPIDENTIFIER_.html) to specify a unique ID for your app. Otherwise the generic app name \"Hollywood\" will be used.",
